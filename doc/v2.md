* Supports stream based serialization/deserialization for large blobs like v1.
* Supports various format as possible including JSON, CBOF, protbuf, etc.
* Keep high level API compatiblity with v1.
* Improve performance.

Non-Goals
---

* 100% API compatibility with v1.
  * Custom `Packer` and custom `Unpacker` will not be supported.
* ABI compatibility with v1.
* Keep performance for compatibility layer espetially custom serializer, IPackable/IUnpackable, and async operation.
* Legacy platform support including Silverlight, .NET Standard 1.x, etc.
* High performance in old platform such as .NET Framework and .NET Core 2.1.
* 100% Unity stability.
