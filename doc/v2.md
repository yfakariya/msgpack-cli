MessagePack for CLI v2
===

Goals
---

* Supports .NET Framework 3.5 and 4.8, .NET Core 2.1 and 3.1, Xamarin Android and iOS, UWP, Unity.
  * Supproted TFM:
    * [ ] `net35`
    * [ ] `net45`
    * [ ] `net4x` (might be. netstandard2.0 is never selected in .NET Framework because of net45 TFM)
    * [ ] `netstandard2.0` (for .NET Core 2.1, Unity IL2CPP)
    * [ ] `netstandard2.1` (for .NET Core 3.1 and after)
    * [ ] `MonoAndroid10` (for Xamarin Android AOT)
    * [ ] `Xamarin.iOS10` (for Xamarin iOS AOT)
    * [ ] `uap` (for .NET Native)
    * [ ] (N/A) (might be, for Unity IL2CPP)
* Supports stream based serialization/deserialization for large blobs like v1.
* Supports various format as possible including JSON, CBOF, protbuf, etc.
* Keep high level API compatiblity with v1.
* Improve performance.

Non-Goals
---

* 100% API compatibility with v1.
  * Custom `Packer` and custom `Unpacker` will not be supported.
* ABI compatibility with v1.
* Keep performance for compatibility layer espetially custom serializer, IPackable/IUnpackable, and async operation.
* Legacy platform support including Silverlight, .NET Standard 1.x, etc.
* High performance in old platform such as .NET Framework and .NET Core 2.1.
* 100% Unity stability.

Status
---

* [x] Encoder/Decoder layer utlizing `ReadOnlySequence<byte>` and `IBufferWriter<byte>`
* [x] Simple JSON serializer with some tweak points for design verification.
* [ ] Debugging features
* [ ] Reflection based object serializer
* [ ] Code generator w/ CodDOM or Roslyn
* [ ] ILGenerator based object serializer
* [x] `SerializationContext`
* [ ] Known serializers
* [x] Timestamp
* [ ] Multi demensional array
* [x] Polymorphism
* [ ] v1 compatiblity layer
  * [ ] `MessagePackSerializer<T>`
  * [ ] `MessagePackObject`
  * [ ] `Packer` and `Unpacker`
  * [ ] `IPackable` and `IUnpackable`
  * other stuff...
* [ ] msgpack for C# compatiblity such as LZ4 support
* [ ] Discriminated Unions
* [ ] More formats
  * [ ] Completes JSON serializer
  * [ ] CBOF serializer
  * [ ] Protobuf serializer
  * other formats...

Breaking Changes
---

* `MessagePackObject` no longer implements `IPackable`.
  * `MessagePackObjectExtensions.AsPackable()` can be used.
* `MessagePackObject.ToString()` is changed as follows:
  * In JSON format, some whitespaces are inserted for readability.
  * In JSON format, blob is emitted as Base64 string isntead of Hex string.
  * In non-JSON format, blog is still emitted as Hex string but it has prefix '0x'.

Improvements
---

* Following types are now marked with `[Serializable]` in .NET Standard 2.0.
  * `MessagePackObject`
  * `MessagePackString`
  * Exceptions
  *   

Bug Fixes
---

* Fix `NullReferenceException` in following cases:
  * Calling `MessagePackObject.ToCharArray()` when `MessagePackObject.IsNil` is `true`.
  * Calling `IDictionary.Keys` for `MessagePackDictionary` before `MessagePackDictionary.Keys` call.
